//WRONG:All the operator for the Matrix need to be write in CoreMatrix Class as virtual
    The computation are never done with the matrix operator. So we don't need of matrix  operator.

//DONE:Matrix need to be reimplemented in SparseMAtrix for better efficiency
    SparseMatrix is implemented with CoreMatrix like Matrix.


Domain Class is require because Grid class don't support the index -1 and N

Grid1D and Grid2D need to be a polymorphism from Grid.

Grid need to be a virtual class.

//DONE:Grid Class must represent a linear or non-linear Grid.
    These are the axes which represent the linearity or the nonlinearity

Add a copy constructor to Axis
