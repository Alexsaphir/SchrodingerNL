//WRONG:All the operator for the Matrix need to be write in CoreMatrix Class as virtual
    The computation are never done with the matrix operator. So we don't need of matrix  operator.

//DONE:Matrix need to be reimplemented in SparseMAtrix for better efficiency
    SparseMatrix is implemented with CoreMatrix like Matrix.


//WRONG:Domain Class is require because Grid class don't support the index -1 and N
    The index are provided by the equation and the boundary condition are specific condition

//DONE:Grid1D and Grid2D need to be a polymorphism from Grid.
//DONE:Grid need to be a virtual class.

//DONE:Grid Class must represent a linear or non-linear Grid.
    These are the axes which represent the linearity or the nonlinearity

//DONE:Add a copy constructor to Axis
    Use clone() to get a copy of Axis

//Warning:The ColumnMatrisProxy don't use an optimized method to access to the data so the sparse matrix can have a wide spread.

Begin the documentation

//WARNING:Need to check if all uint replaced by int are > 0.
